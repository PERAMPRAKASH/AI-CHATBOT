**DESCRIPTION:**

You may have seen chatbots on multiple websites, as they are now essential components for modern websites and apps. If you are unfamiliar, a chatbot is a computer program that serves as a virtual assistant and is capable of understanding user queries and providing relevant responses.

Building a chatbot is a practical way for beginner web developers to gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as these skills are crucial for creating real-world projects. So, in this blog post, I’ll guide you through creating a working chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.

In this chatbot, users can ask any question and receive instant responses. This chatbot has an elegant and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Keep in mind that to generate a response to the user query, this chatbot uses the OpenAI API, which is free.
Please note that your chatbot is currently unable to retrieve responses to your questions because you have not provided your API key in the AP_KEY variable. To get a free API key from OpenAI, sign up for an account @ <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys/>

” Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5 credit for your API usage. If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page.”

The above code provided follows a simple flow. First, it displays the user’s message in the chatbox and uses the OpenAI API to generate an appropriate response to the message. While waiting for the API response, a “Thinking…” message is shown. Once the response is received, it replaces the “Thinking…” message in the chatbox.
**Conclusion**
In conclusion, creating a working chatbot allows you to apply your skills to a real-world application. I hope that by following the steps in this post, you’ve successfully created your own chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To further improve your web development skills, you can try recreating the ChatGPT Clone Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps you expand your knowledge by creating a ChatGPT clone with additional features like dark/light themes and saved chats using local storage.
